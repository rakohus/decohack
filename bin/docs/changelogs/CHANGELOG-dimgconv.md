DImgConv
--------

### Changed for 1.1.0

* `Fixed` DImgConv would crash if no palette was provided but "palettes" default mode was set and a metadata file tried to change the mode for a file.


### Changed for 1.0.1

* `Fixed` DImgConv did not properly rename files to ".lmp" on convert if both source 
  and destination were directories. (Issue #39)


### Changed for 1.0.0

* Initial Release.
